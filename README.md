# Shells

This repository contains multiple development shells, organized in subdirectories.

## Usage

You can enter any shell directly from GitHub without cloning the whole repo locally.  
Just replace `{shell-dir}` with the name of the subdirectory you want:

```bash
nix develop "github:fpedrazav02/shells?dir={shell-dir}" --no-write-lock-file --refresh
```
